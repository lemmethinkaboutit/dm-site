       <img  src="img/causes of digital marketing failure.jpg"  class="center align-items-center rounded-3 text-center img-fluid" alt="...">
       <h2>Digital Marketing Strategy </h2>
          <p>Most companies, and even digital marketing agencies, do not develop a comprehensive digital marketing strategy before they delve into their marketing efforts. Instead, they quickly launch digital campaigns to see what works. Even if you know and use best practices, without an effective digital marketing strategy, you will only waste time and money.</p>
        <h3>Digital Marketing Funnel</h3>
          <p>Digital Marketing funnel is a strategic model that simplifies the customer journey and makes it easier for companies to follow. These solutions map out each stage of their client’s decision process and plan the steps they want to take in each.The biggest benefit of having a digital marketing funnel is its measurability. It shows you where you’re losing customers, and where you can improve your strategy.</p>
        <h3>Stages of Funnel</h3>
          <p>There are four main digital marketing funnel stages:
          <br><br>
          <b> Stage 1 </b> : Awareness: This is when a person first becomes aware of your business or website. This can occur through a wide variety of means including organic search, social media, word of mouth, email, press release, links from another website, and more.
          <br><br>
          <b> Stage 2 </b> : Discovery: During this phase, a visitor will start reading a few pages on your website, consume content, and learn more about your company and what you offer. 
          <br><br>
          <b> Stage 3 </b> : Consideration: This is when your visitors will spend more time reading your site, consuming your media, and even joining your email list.
          <br><br>
          <b> Stage 4 </b> : Conversion: The conversion process can take some time, or it can be quick. This usually depends on what you’re selling, the price point, and how pressing of a problem your products and services solve.
          </p>

      <h2>Companies Following Excellent Digital Marketing Practices</h2>
        <h3>ASOS</h3>
          <p>ASOS has been so successful because it knows its audience: millennials. And ASOS knows that 90.4% of millennials use social media, and that the average person spends just under two and a half hours per day browsing social channels. One of the brand’s best social media campaigns involved UGC (user generated content). ASOS asked its Instagram followers to share their favourite ASOS outfits online with the hashtag ‘#AsSeenOnMe’, with the opportunity of being featured on the ASOS social media channels in return.</p>
        <h3>Netflix</h3>
          <p>How does Netflix keep customers interested? It gets personal. Personalisation marketing is an effective way of cutting through the noise. In fact, 91% of consumers say that they're more willing to engage with businesses that provide offers directly to them. Not only does Netflix personalise to perfection, it doesn’t pressure its customers too much, either. By this, we mean Netflix doesn’t bombard subscribers with suggestions. It knows that online consumers are more likely to respond to one, relatable email rather than a bucket-load of non-specific content. As a digital marketer, you should always stagger your emails to get staggering results. Netflix sends highly personalised emails and push notifications that are easy to read, with a clear CTA (call to action) button – which usually just says ‘Play’. For example, as a Netflix customer, you’ll receive an email that recommends a film based on your previous choices, while addressing you by your first name.</p>
        <h3>Nike</h3>
          <p>In 2018, Nike partnered with Facebook Messenger’s chatbot platform, Snaps, in order to promote its Jordan brand. The bot’s purpose was to deliver content from the latest Jordan blog, newsletter, and website, to Nike’s Facebook followers via Messenger. Users could interact with the Jordan bot about the latest releases, and they could even customise the times they received notifications. This strategy was a huge success, with the brand claiming it saw open rates of 87%, which is enormous compared to the usual measly 21.33% open rate for emails for all industries. </p>
        <h3>Airbnb</h3>
          <p> Having built a huge community of renters and hosters – approximately 150 million active users – Airbnb is now one of the highest flying names in the travel industry. The key to Airbnb’s success has been through building trust, which has primarily be achieved through social influencer marketing. Airbnb has partnered with many famous names in order to generate a buzz and brand awareness. It even partnered with a celebrity dog, Marnie the Dog, to promote its dog-friendly properties. </p>
        
      <h2>Types of websites</h2>
        <h3>Static Websites</h3>
          <p>Static sites are web pages that are pre-built and served to the user exactly as they were built, without any server-side processing or user-specific customization. Static sites are generated using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which are served directly to the user's web browser.
          <br>A typical example of that would be this site. as it is used to provide information.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic Websites</h3>
          <p>Dynamic sites are web pages that are generated on the server-side in response to user requests, using server-side programming languages and databases. They allow for user-specific content and interactions, such as personalized recommendations and user authentication. Dynamic sites are often used for e-commerce and social media websites, but can be more complex to build and maintain than static sites.</p>
